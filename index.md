## Professional life and Education 
> "Some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again."
> --_C. S. Lewis_

### Lebiniz Supercomputing Centre
`2021 : Today`
- [AstroLab](https://doku.lrz.de/astrolab-10746577.html) Team Leader
  
In addition to application support, I coordinated the activities of the AstroLab and proactively proposed activities and projects for junior lab members, especially on heterogeneous/GPU computing.

`2018 : Today`
- Part of _Computational X Support_ Team
- Member of AstroLab, application support for Astrophycs
  
Application support activities introduced to a vast user base, as well as to products and solutions from vendors, while gaining experience in profiling tools and code modernization efforts.
The [high-level support](https://doku.lrz.de/high-level-support-projects-10747323.html) activivities in the _Gauss Center from Supercomputig_ often resulted in well-received HPC publications and conference submissions in large collaborations, and ultimately to the provision of new services to LRZ users.
  
`2015 : 2018` __Institut d'Astrophisique de Paris, Paris, France__
- Postoctoral Researcher  "BLACK Fellowship"

I investigated the roles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on keeping Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters stable. I was granted large allocation on 
Supercomputers and set up large (several thousands of cores) numerical models. 

`2011 : 2015` __Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany__
- Ph.D. Student within the "International Max Planck Research School"

I used a broad range of numerical simulations to help constrain the role of Active Galactic Nuclei on the star formation rates in observed galaxies. 
I also learned about the role of numerical models in the scientific method, and largely improved my parallel programming skills.
  
`2006 : 2011`
- SSC
`2006 : 2011`
- bachelor and master
