## Career
> "Be patient, for the world is broad and wide."
> -- _E. A. Abbott_

### HPC Expert
`2021 : Today` __Lebiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- [AstroLab](https://doku.lrz.de/astrolab-10746577.html) Team Leader
  
In addition to application support, I coordinated the activities of the AstroLab and proactively proposed activities and projects for junior lab members, especially on heterogeneous/GPU computing, leveraging and promoting individual skills and wishes.

`2018 : Today`
__Lebiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- Part of _Computational X Support_ Team
- Member of AstroLab, application support for Astrophysics
  
Application support activities introduced me to a vast user base, and to products and solutions from HPC vendors, while provided me with experience in profiling tools and code modernization efforts.
The [research](https://doku.lrz.de/research-and-development-projects-10747346.html) and [high-level support](https://doku.lrz.de/high-level-support-projects-10747323.html) activivities in the _Gauss Center from Supercomputing_ often resulted in large collaborations, well-received HPC publications and conference submissions, and the provisioning of novel services to LRZ users.

### Researcher
`2015 : 2018`
__Institut d'Astrophisique de Paris, Paris, France__
- Postoctoral Researcher  "BLACK Fellow"

I was granted large allocation on national Supercomputers and learnt to set up large (several thousands of cores) numerical models, in order to investigate the roles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the stability of Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters. 

__Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany__
`2011 : 2015` 
- **Magna cum laude** Doctorate in Physics within the "International Max Planck Research School"

I used a broad range of numerical simulations to help constrain the role of Active Galactic Nuclei on the star formation rates in observed galaxies. I also learned about the role of numerical models in the scientific method, and largely improved my parallel programming skills.

### Student
__Universita' di Catania, Catania, Italy__
`2006 : 2011`
- B.Sc. and M.Sc. student in Physics, oriented to Astrophysics and and Space Physics
- Pupil at the Excellency School "Scuola Superiore di Catania" (SSC)

My undergraduate studies gave me a scientific education well-balanced among theorethical and experimental Physics, astronomical observations and computer science. In parallel, my SSC scholarship provided complementary and advanced courses such as _numerical methods for science_, _Neuroinformatics and neural networks_, _Game Theory_ and _Statistical Physics_ and allowed the discussion an additional dissertation.
