## Career
> _"Be patient, for the world is broad and wide." <br> - E. A. Abbott_

### HPC Expert
`2021-Today` __Leibiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- [AstroLab](https://doku.lrz.de/astrolab-10746577.html) Team Leader <br> In addition to application support, I **coordinate the activities of the AstroLab** and proactively propose activities and **projects for junior lab members**, especially in the emerging field of heterogeneous/GPU computing, promoting individual skills and professional growth.

`2018-Today` __Leibiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- Part of _Computational X Support_ Team
- Member of AstroLab, application support for Astrophysics
<br> Application support activities introduce me to a **vast base of science users**, and to products and solutions from **several HPC vendors**, while providing me with deep knowledge of **profiling tools** and **code modernization** techniques. <br>
The [research](https://doku.lrz.de/research-and-development-projects-10747346.html) and [high-level support](https://doku.lrz.de/high-level-support-projects-10747323.html) activivities in the _Gauss Center from Supercomputing_ often result in large collaborations, well-received HPC publications and conference submissions, and the provisioning of novel services to LRZ users.

### Researcher
`2015-2018` __Institut d'Astrophisique de Paris, Paris, France__
- Postdoctoral Researcher  "BLACK Fellow" <br>
I was granted **large allocations on national Supercomputers** and learned to set up large (several thousands of cores) numerical models, in order to investigate the roles of _Active Galactic Nuclei_ (AGN) on the stability of Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters. 

### Student
`2011-2015` __Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany__
- _Magna cum laude_ Doctorate in Physics within the "International Max Planck Research School"  <br>
I used a broad set of **numerical simulations** to help constraining the role of Active Galactic Nuclei on the star formation rates in observed galaxies. I also learned about the role of numerical models in the scientific process, and largely improved my **parallel programming** skills.

`2006-2011` __Universita' di Catania, Catania, Italy__
- B.Sc. and M.Sc. student in Physics, oriented to Astrophysics and and Space Physics
- Pupil at the Excellency School "Scuola Superiore di Catania" (SSC) <br>
My undergraduate studies gave me a scientific education well-balanced among theorethical and **experimental** Physics, astronomical observations and **computer science**. <br> In parallel, my SSC scholarship provided complementary and **advanced courses** such as _Numerical Methods for Physics_, _Neuroinformatics and Neural Networks_, _Game Theory_ and _Statistical Physics_ and allowed the discussion of an additional dissertation.

### Software development
`2024-Today` 
- GPU Computing with Julia <br>
The possibilities offered by Julia as a high-level, HPC language caught my attention, also in connection with [use cases by AstroLab teammates](https://doku.lrz.de/code-modernization-projects-10747323.html#CodeModernizationProjects-GPU-offloadingandParallelisationofGaPSE.jl(2024+)).
Hence it is desirable to use **Julia for GPU programming**, using [oneAPI.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/oneAPI.jl)
(specific for Intel GPUs, with library interfaces requiring minimal code changes) and [KernelAnstraction.jl](https://juliagpu.github.io/KernelAbstractions.jl/stable/)
(for any CPU/GPU, for the user to program their parellel kernels manually, SYCL-style). Both packages provide large speedup and are being documented for LRZ user advantage.

`2023-Today`
- SYCL on heterogenous harware <br>
In synergy with DPEcho, I became increasingly involved in the LRZ efforts in providing and testing SYCL compilers (e.g. Intel oneAPI, Intel LLVM, [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp), also with the [Spack package manager](https://packages.spack.io/)) on SuperMUC and the [BEAST testbed](https://www.lrz.de/presse/ereignisse/2022-05-26-BEAST-en/). This experience largely improved my ability of **providing sofware as a service**.

`2022-Today`
- [DPEcho](https://github.com/LRZ-BADW/DPEcho)<br>
Through this code development project, carried on with Intel support, I became **proficient in heterogenous computing** with SYCL. Born as SYCL porting of the GR-MHD ECHO code, its focus shifted to its **excellent benchmarking capabilities**, including CPU and GPU **energy-to-solution** measurements, on both HPC-grade and consumer-grade hardware.

`2020-Today`
- Python on Intel hardware<br>
Vendor-provided distributions for python can greatly enhance performance and parallelism with mininal user effort. In the case of the [yt-project](https://yt-project.org/doc/index.html) for simulation post-processing, the workflow I developed for **Intel CPUs** is now acknowledged in the [official documentation](https://yt-project.org/doc/installing.html#intel-distribution-for-python). More recently, I targeted Intel GPUs with the [Intel Data Parallel Extensions for Python ](https://intelpython.github.io/DPEP/main/), yieldng up to **tenfold speedup over CPUs** with no code changes (in prep).

`2019-Today` 
- [VisIt](https://doku.lrz.de/visit-10746458.html) and [OSPRay](https://www.ospray.org/)<br>
The scientific visualization software VisIt recently embedded Intel OSPRay as a very efficient CPU/GPU renderer for ray tracing. I maintain such service for LRZ users with direct contact and support of developers of both software. Especially VisIt, with its complex server/client GUI interface, **proved a challenging corner case** in software provisioning that is now an example of efficiency, well appreciated by users.
