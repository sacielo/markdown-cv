## Career
> _"Be patient, for the world is broad and wide." - E. A. Abbott_

### HPC Expert
`2021-Today` __Lebiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- [AstroLab](https://doku.lrz.de/astrolab-10746577.html) Team Leader
  
In addition to application support, I **coordinated the activities of the AstroLab** and proactively proposed activities and **projects for junior lab members**, especially in the emerging field of heterogeneous/GPU computing, promoting individual skills and professional growth.

`2018-Today`
__Lebiniz Supercomputing Centre__
- Part of _Computational X Support_ Team
- Member of AstroLab, application support for Astrophysics
  
Application support activities introduced me to a **vast base of science users**, and to products and solutions from **several HPC vendors**, while providing me with deep knowledge of **profiling tools** and **code modernization** techniques.
The [research](https://doku.lrz.de/research-and-development-projects-10747346.html) and [high-level support](https://doku.lrz.de/high-level-support-projects-10747323.html) activivities in the _Gauss Center from Supercomputing_ often resulted in large collaborations, well-received HPC publications and conference submissions, and the provisioning of novel services to LRZ users.

### Researcher
`2015-2018`
__Institut d'Astrophisique de Paris, Paris, France__
- Postdoctoral Researcher  "BLACK Fellow"

I was granted **large allocation on national Supercomputers** and learned to set up large (several thousands of cores) numerical models, in order to investigate the roles of _Active Galactic Nuclei_ (AGN) on the stability of Galaxies and Galaxy Clusters. 

__Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany__
`2011-2015` 
- _Magna cum laude_ Doctorate in Physics within the "International Max Planck Research School"

I used a broad set of **numerical simulations** to help constrain the role of Active Galactic Nuclei on the star formation rates in observed galaxies. I also learned about the role of numerical models in the scientific process, and largely improved my **parallel programming** skills.

### Student
__Universita' di Catania, Catania, Italy__
`2006-2011`
- B.Sc. and M.Sc. student in Physics, oriented to Astrophysics and and Space Physics
- Pupil at the Excellency School "Scuola Superiore di Catania" (SSC)

My undergraduate studies gave me a scientific education well-balanced among theorethical and **experimental** Physics, astronomical observations and **computer science**. In parallel, my SSC scholarship provided complementary and **advanced courses** such as _Numerical Methods for Physics_, _Neuroinformatics and Neural Networks_, _Game Theory_ and _Statistical Physics_ and allowed the discussion of an additional dissertation.
